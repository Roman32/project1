README for ftps and ftpc programs.

Author: Roman Claprood
Project: Lab Client/Server programs to send 
	files(tested files were .jpg).
Due Date: //

To compile, use the command "make". Will make 3 executables: ftpc,ftps and tpcd.

To run, the client (ftpc, tcpd and troll MUST be on Epsilon server!!
To run ftpc  is ./ftpc filename.
to run tcpd is ./tcpd.
To run troll is troll 6666 -s0 -x0

To Run the server it must be on the BETA server!
to run ftps is ./ftps 9997
to run tcpd is ./tcpd.

ftpc will send file to the tcpd process, then the tcpd process will pass to troll (All on same machine).
Troll then sends the packets to a tcpd process running on another machine, where it is finally passed to
ftps.  File is then stored in output file.

Currently working. Fix was to make buffer receiving from troll 1016 bytes. Then with sendto to the server make buffer
buffer+16 and bytes -16.
